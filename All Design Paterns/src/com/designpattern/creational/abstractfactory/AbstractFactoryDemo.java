/*
 * Abstract Factory Pattern :
   Says that just define an interface or abstract class for creating families of related (or dependent) objects but without specifying their concrete sub-classes.
   That means Abstract Factory lets a class returns a factory of classes. So, this is the reason that Abstract Factory Pattern is one level higher than the Factory Pattern.
   It is also known as Kit.

   Usage :
   When you want to provide a library of objects that does not show implementations and only reveals interfaces.
   When the system needs to be configured with one of a multiple family of objects.
